Mission:  
Autonomous Systems Group Delta will deploy UAVs and UGVs to assist fire response units in managing an ongoing wildfire in Sector RED near the Wildbrush National Preserve. Initial deployment begins at 0500 local time.

Commander's Intent:  
Purpose: Augment ground firefighting teams by providing continuous surveillance, hazard mapping, and logistical support without impeding human operations.

Key Tasks:  
- Deploy aerial surveillance drones with thermal imaging for live perimeter mapping  
- Create a digital terrain model to assess fire spread likelihood  
- Drop fire suppression capsules on isolated flare-ups  
- Deliver supplies (water, batteries, radios) to ground teams in remote zones  
- Maintain a real-time communications relay between command and remote squads

End State:  
Ground teams are fully supported with live data and supply logistics, flare-up risks are minimized, and the perimeter is continuously tracked with no UAV incidents.
